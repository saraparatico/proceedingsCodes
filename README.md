# proceedingsCodes
Codes associated to the chapter "Estimation of optimal inlet boundary conditions for blood flow assessment in abdominal aortic aneurysm using variational data assimilation", which was submitted to the Proceedings of the FEniCS Conference 2024.

## Requirements & installation
This project was developed using Python 3.8.10. It is recommended to run the scripts in a Python environment compatible with this version. The development was carried out using PyCharm as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

For the installation of FEniCS, please refer to the official installation guide at: https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/

## Description
This repository contains two main directories, each corresponding to different simulation setups:
- "codes_syntheticGeometries"
This directory includes all the necessary code to run simulations on simple synthetic geometries, such as a 2D rectangular domain and a 3D cylindrical domain.
- "codes_realAAA"
This directory is designed to run simulations on patient-specific abdominal aortic aneurysm geometries.

Both directories have a similar structure, which includes the following key files:
- "main.py": it is the core of the project and is the file to execute in both cases to run the simulations.
- "v0.json": it contains all the simulation parameters. To adjust the working conditions (e.g., switching from 2D to 3D simulations), simply modify this file. All other code files remain unchanged.
- "solver.py": it contains the solvers used for the simulations.
- "problem.py": it file defines the problem class. It is responsible for reading the mesh, defining function spaces, and including the functions that read control inputs and observations. The control and observation functions are generated by functions defined in "utils.py".

## Usage
To run the simulation, modify the v0.json file to set the desired parameters (e.g., geometry, simulation conditions). Then, execute main.py. The structure is designed to allow easy adjustments for different geometries and simulation setups.
